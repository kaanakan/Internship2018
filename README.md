The work I have done while doing my Internship at METU CENG ImageLab

## Abstract
The work I have done was trying different models for cognitive state classification and analyzing the Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) time series data recorded in three dimensional voxel coordinates by clustering the Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) responses. The experimental results show that, on a multiclass fMRI dataset,  the Deep Learning models improves the classification accuracy (an average 12.5% increase when using Convolutional Neural Networks and an average 14.43% increase when using Multilayer Perceptrons) compared to a classical multi voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) method. 

** The baseline accuracy of the MVPA 33.73% on average. It is taken from MSc Thesis of [Gunes Sucu](https://scholar.google.com.tr/citations?user=Z97AJZQAAAAJ&hl=tr)
